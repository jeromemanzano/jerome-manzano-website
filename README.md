# jeromemanzano.com v1

Welcome to the first version of my website [jeromemanzano.com](https://www.jeromemanzano.com). This is built using `Vite` and hosted in `Netlify`

PS: This is a work in progress so you'll notice a few things missing and a lot of `TODO` comments here and there.

## Setup

1. Install all dependecies

```
yarn
```

2. Run locally

```
yarn dev
```

## Backend

As you have probably seen, this connects to an api to retrieve some of the information displayed (I know it seems like overkill, but I have reasons for doing so). The backend repository is currently private. I'll change it to public once I have configured some security features.
